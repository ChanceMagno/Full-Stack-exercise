# Triplog

### The Description

 With the visual TripLog application the client is provided an easy and quick way to log daily commuting trips. Features of this application include the ability to log multiple segments per day, identify and select a mode of transportation from a list of 7, log daily time increment for commuting (eventually improving awareness about commute options), edit and delete trip segments as needed and visually track days where no trip has been logged. All of this is user friendly with a visually simple vertical trip log array as well as a floating trip log form, allowing for easy daily review and input of commuting data. Commuters are also able to click the trip suggestions button for ideas to improve commuting time and impact as data is accumulated by the system.
